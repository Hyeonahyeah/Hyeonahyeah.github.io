## Project Requirements

### Content
 This portfolio site showcases my personal and professional background in a clean and modern single-page design.  
 I chose a **minimal, scroll-snap layout** to create a smooth navigation flow between sections.  
 The aesthetic focuses on **contrast and readability**.
 To match my interest, I added a little automated chat flow.
- ✅ A profile picture with styled avatar effects  
- ✅ A biography (well over 100 words) introducing my professional background, mindset, and personal interests  
- ✅ A functional **Contact button** leading to the Connect section
- ✅ A "Projects" section with GitHub links (More links to be added)
- ✅ External links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, Spotify and email (with auto-filled)
​
### Technical
 For the technical implementation, I focused on **accessibility, responsiveness, and modern web standards**.  
 I structured the site as a **multi-section single-page app** with scroll-snap for a smooth user experience.  
 Version control was done with Git, and the site was deployed using GitHub Pages.
 Design is fully responsive, adapting from mobile to desktop with **media queries** and **flex/grid layouts**.  
 Semantic HTML elements (e.g., `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<h1>–<h3>`) were used for better accessibility.  
- ✅ At least 2 "pages" (in this case, sections: Home, Bio, Projects, Connect)  
- ✅ Version controlled with Git
- ✅ Deployed on GitHub pages
- ✅ Responsive design with CSS grid/flex + media queries 
- ✅ Semantic HTML structure

### Bonus
 I also included several **enhancements beyond the requirements**:
- ✅ Hover, active, and focus styles for buttons and social icons
- ✅ JavaScript for dynamic elements:
  - Typing animation in the Hero (Home) section  
  - Interactive "About Me" slider with swipe gestures  
  - Automated chat-style interaction for the Hero assistant
